# Real-Time-Stock-Market-Data-Pipeline-with-Apache-Kafka-AWS




Architected a high-performance, real-time stock market data pipeline using Apache Kafka for scalable data streaming with producers and consumers. Deployed Kafka clusters on AWS EC2, used Python for data transformation into JSON, and stored streaming data in Amazon S3. Leveraged AWS Glue for automated ETL processes and Amazon Athena for real-time querying and analytics, enabling instant insights with SQL on large datasets.
